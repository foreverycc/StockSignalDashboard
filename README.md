## 📊 Stock Analysis Dashboard with Database Integration

### ✨ New: Database Integration
This dashboard now includes **SQLite database integration** for better data organization and historical tracking while maintaining full backward compatibility.

**Key Benefits:**
- 🏛️ **Centralized Storage**: All data in one organized database file
- 📈 **Historical Tracking**: Keep track of analysis results over time  
- ⚡ **Better Performance**: Faster data loading and querying
- 🔄 **Backward Compatible**: All existing functionality preserved
- 🛡️ **Data Integrity**: ACID transactions and consistent structure

### 🚀 Quick Start with Database

1. **Migration** (one-time setup):
```bash
python migrate_to_database.py
```

2. **Inspect Database**:
```bash
python inspect_database.py
```

3. **Use as Before** - All existing code works unchanged!
